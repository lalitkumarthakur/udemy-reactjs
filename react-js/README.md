# udemy-reactjs

Reactjs learned from Maximilian Udemy course and Tech Gun Youtube Channel.

** Understanding Folder Structure **

The "js-refresher" contains Javascript topics needs to be revised for React.js Course.

And

"React-JS" Folder contains 2 folders -

1. OLD React.js - which contains "create-react-app" course.

2. New React.js - which contains "vite+react" course.

Further details will be updated later. Due to deadlines, I am just focusing on learning and not adding explanatory notices which will help beginners to learn similar to my javascript course.
